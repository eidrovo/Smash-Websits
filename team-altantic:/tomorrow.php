		<h1> Tomorrow </h1>
			<p>In my free time, I like to be active. Over the summer, I bike ride and longboard from Central Park to Astoria, multiply times. Basketball is always the game to play, depending on the competition at the moment. I don’t watch TV at all besides Bloomfield on youtube and on-going anime online. Like I mention before, heading to the gym often times in a week is the new goal for me now.My end goal is to get my master’s in finances. Where do you ask? No clue, where every they accepted me at a fair price. Over the summer, I got the chances to travel around America. Got the opportunities to visit eight new states in the United States of America. Not only did I travel through the car but as well in a truck, plane, and train. I like the experiences of getting to see new things for the first time.  Got me thinking of looking at types of jobs that include traveling to new areas as their job.  What the future has in store for me is the amount of work I put in for the next couple of years. Now or never at this peace for now
